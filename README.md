'Knowledge representation and reasoning' is a branch of computer science
that investigates how knowledge can be represented in a form that
computers can process. 

The techniques of knowledge representation and reasoning can be applied
to education in two ways:
- Intelligent tutoring systems are computer programs that mimic human
tutors. Knowledge representation is used in their creation to represent 
the knowledge that the tutor is supposed to teach.
- Formalization requires very detailed understanding. The task of 
formalizing knowledge in a machine-readable format can be performed by 
students to improve their understanding of whatever they are trying to 
learn.

In this project I want to investigate how techniques of 
knowledge representation and reasoning can be applied to learning how
to play chess. I plan to accomplish the following two things:
- Write a chess engine that can explain how it selects its moves. A
human player should be able execute the techniques used in searching
for moves (no evaulation of millions of positions or looking ahead
dozens of moves)
- Write a series of lessons and exercises that allow a student to
recreate such a chess engine for himself
